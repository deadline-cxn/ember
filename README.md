# EMBER MMORPG Game Client / Server / Master Server Suite
=========================================================
* Note: This project is not associated with the Worldforge project in any way, despite the engine being named Ember. It is purely coincidental, and I only recently found out about the Worldforge Ember client. I may change the name in the future so that there isn't any confusion. 

This is a 3D OpenGL based MMORPG.
The goal is to make this work on any OS.

This repository makes use of the DLStorm C/C++ repository.
You will have to clone it and add it to your compile paths.

You may clone this repository and do whatever you want to do with it.

Being that it is basically free for use, anything that gets contributed 
to this project will subsequently be under the same license as well.

Please feel free to contribute to the project.

Notes:
I have updated this project to work with VSCode as of April 2020
