# EMBER MMORPG Game Client / Server / Master Server Suite

* Note: This project is not associated with the Worldforge project in any way, despite the engine being named Ember. It is purely coincidental, and I only recently found out about the Worldforge Ember client. I may change the name in the future so that there isn't any confusion. 

This is a 3D OpenGL based MMORPG. The goal is to make this work on any OS and to be able to scale to accomodate higher loads. ie; A simple bedazzled type of gem game might only take about 2M to store it's assets, but could also be expanded to have 20G of assets for a mmorpg simply by adding new assets and (configs and/or scripts) then restarting the server.

Think of it as if Quake were to be merged with Everquest and Super Mario Brothers.
