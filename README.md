Mantra (EMBER MMORPG Game Client / Server / Master Server Suite)
=========================================================
* Note: This project is not associated with the Worldforge project in any way, despite the engine being named Ember. It is purely coincidental, and I only recently found out about the Worldforge Ember client. I may change the name in the future so that there isn't any confusion. 

This is a 3D OpenGL based MMORPG.
The goal is to make this work on any OS.

This repository makes use of my DLStorm C/C++ repository.
You will have to clone it and add it to your compile paths.

Additionally, you need my SDK repository.
Or, you could download the corresponding SDK's needed on your own.

If you don't know what any of that means, then you need to learn
more about how to compile C/C++ programs. I can not, and will not,
be someone's tutor for learning how to program. That being said,
this project is licensed using the BSD license.

You may clone this repository and do whatever you want to do with it.

Being that it is basically free for use, anything that gets contributed 
to this project will subsequently be under the same license as well.

If you see anything that needs to be fixed, please send me 
a message. If you want to help with the source code, 3D models, Textures,
sound, or other assets, please let me know, or send them to me in an email.

Notes:
I am using Code::Blocks 12.11 with the MinGW compiler.
